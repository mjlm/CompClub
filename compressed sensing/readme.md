# Compressed sensing

2015-07-21 by Matthias, Stephen Thornquist, Ari, Selmaan

The compressed sensing framework provides a proof that you can perfectly reconstruct a sparse signal embedded in a high-dimensional space using surprisingly few measurements -- much fewer than the dimensionality of the space. The framework also provides tools for how to do it.

Compressed sensing can therefore be thought of as a method for dimensionality reduction. It has applications in data analysis, but may also be implemented in the brain and explain how the brain reduces and expands the dimensionality of signal representations.
