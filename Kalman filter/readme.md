The Kalman Filter is an algorithm for optimally incorporating measurements (sensory evidence) into a model of a dynamical system. In the context of sensorimotor integration, the Kalman Filter finds how proprioceptive feedback should be combined with predictions from the brain's forward model of the body for optimal estimation of the body's state.

Chong introduced the Kalman Filter and Matthias presented a paper by Daniel Wolpert et al. that suggests that humans combine a forward model with sensory feedback to obtain a better estimate of body position:
